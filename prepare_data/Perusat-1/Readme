## The pre-processing part the following steps were followed:
 1. Create the labels (QGIS):
	-To use the NDWI to start with a basic label (when we have rivers with sediments this method doesnt work)
	-To use a vector and create the labels point by point.
 2. Filter the labels/masks:
	-Because there is false positives or false negatives it is need touse  filtres: 
 		--> filter_masks_1step.py
 3.Screate the  Patches Images and masks
	-Create the patches to increase the number of images in the dataset and dont consider the images which have more than 15% of black areas (no information) 
		--> create_dataset_Perusat_2.py
